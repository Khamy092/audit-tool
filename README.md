This is a tool I developed to automate an audit process at work.
The tool uses Selenium to automate browser navigation and download of 2,500+ excel files from a platform.
Openpyxl is then used to navigate through every downloaded excel file and perform the audit function.
The results are then put together and generated into a neat human-readable excel output.
This tool has been wrapped into a GUI based application using tkinter, and generated into an executable file.
